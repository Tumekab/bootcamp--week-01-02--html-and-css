---

# This weeks brief

---

### Business background

I’m a professional photographer with an established portfolio.

I’d like to increase my online presence and promote my business through digital means.

---

### Brief

Build a website that showcases the photographers work.

Interested parties should be able to get in touch.

The client should be able to add work and other interesting content.

---

### Let's do this together

- What is this site for?
- Who are our users?
- What will they do?
- What technologies will they use?

---

# Sitemap

---

- Site maps used during the planning of a Web site by its designers.
- Human-visible listings, typically hierarchical, of the pages on a site.
also
- Structured listings intended for web crawlers such as search engines.

### Articulates page structure of a website

Think about:

- Hierarchy of content
- Sections and pages
- User journeys

---

### Simply a list

# Scamping & Wireframing

---

### Articulates elements and layout

Start to think about:

- Content hierarchy on the page
- Layout + UI
- User journeys - how to get around
- Responsive behaviour

---

# Scamps

---

A quick sketch with a pen and paper

As your discussing the site, just sketch it out

You can throw it out and start again easily

---

![Detailed Scamp](day06/01designProcess/detailScamp.png)

---

### Exercise:

Quickly draw out a page of the app with pen and paper.

Annotate, make notes, get thinking.

---

# Wireframes

---


### No visual design

Literally just what is where & how it works

---

Crucially, a way of thinking about the content and behaviour **before visual design is considered.**

That’s why wireframes will look **bland and grey.**

We want to **focus on the function** of the site before we start thinking about style.

---

### Think detail

Give to client.
Give to a designer.
Give to developers & sys admins.

All elements & functionality.

Include notes and interaction.

### Pro tip

#### Explain what it is for

When sending a wireframe link to a client you should include an explanation of what a wireframe is for, what feedback is useful, and what isn’t

“It works well but I don’t like the grey”

---

### Pro tip

#### Explain what it’s for on the wireframe

Clients will circulate a wireframe link within the organisation, often without your helpful explanation of what a wireframe is for...

...so add the description to the wireframes front page!

---

![A wireframe with a tip](day06/01designProcess/wireframeTip.png)

---

Remember it's like the technical documentation version of the design
