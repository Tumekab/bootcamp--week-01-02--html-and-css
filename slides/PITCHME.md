#### Before We Begin: Class Rules

- This is essentially a workplace
	- Be respectful & kind |
	- Keep it clean |
	- Timekeeping |
- Daily
- Please take your breaks |
- Please let me take my breaks. |


Note:
If you have any problems we are all here. That includes with any of us. Speak in turn.
We expect you to be on time and also keep good time, if this can't be the case we expect to be told. Obviously you're not robots - illnesses, appointments, holidays, lateness - all expected, but pls let us know in good time so we can accomodate
Wash up after yourself. Be mindful there are 15 people using one bathroom. There are evening courses here too, so you leave things at your own risk. If you borrow books (which you are welcome) give them back.

#### What I expect from you

- To have done your prep |
- To be familiar with your computer |
- To take notes |
- To know your folders & files and... |

---

- Never put a space in a file or folder name |
- NEVER USE SPACES WHEN NAMING ANYTHING EVER |

Note:
You should be able to use your terminal and be familiar with your computers file system. I sent an email and I expect everything to have been done.
Every computer is different. I don't know where you keep your files, please don't ask me. I am here to teach you HTML & CSS and I will try with the other things, but I make no guarantees.
Notes: they will be provided but your format is the best format.

#### Learning is weird

- Remember that this week |
- To not be able to do everything |
- Try for yourself - it's about you |
- Not to finish everything |
- There is homework |

Note:
it's super duper ok. Honestly! Don't panic, let's think about what you're just about to undertake.
There are milestones and I will tell you them. I want you to practise
Now I know you all have lives, but what you put into this course you get out

---

#### What you can expect from me

- To teach you how to HTML & CSS at an industry standard |
	- Code reviews |
	- Quizs & feedback |
	- Resources |

Note:
So you can go into a workplace at the end of this course and hold your own. Don't get me wrong, you are still going to have a bucket load to learn. I can not teach you EVERYTHING in two weeks, _but_ I will try!
There will be a test & I am not giving you the answers before then
I have done the exercises myself, they are all part of the resources. But you need to learn, copying and pasting what I have done is not going to help you do that.
No one does. If anyone tells you they do, they're not really the kind of people you want to listen to.

#### What you can expect from me

- To teach you how to keep on learning, because you will never stop |
- To let you know this is hard work |
- I don't know everything about everything |
