As you're discussing the site, just sketch it out

You can throw it out and start again easily

Think about:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Content hierarchy on the page
    \item Layout + UI
    \item User journeys: How to get around
    \item Responsive behavior
\end{itemize}

\begin{infobox}{Scamps \& Scamping}
    The term \textit{scamping} comes from films. Storyboards go through sketch out versions before the final storyboard is produced. This process is called scamping.
