\subsubsection{What do you want to ask the designer}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Artwork file
    \item Responsive designs
    \item Fonts
    \item Other assets (images, icons) can export from artwork yourself
    \item Media (videos, audio)
    \item Animations, interactivity (hovers)
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{What to expect}

Lots of designs

\begin{itemize}
    \item Home
    \item Standard page: About
    \item Contact page
    \item Article list page: news
    \item Individual article page
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Different program files}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Photoshop (PSD)
    \item InDesign (INDD)
    \item Possibly Illustrator
    \item Sketch (not Adobe, mac only)
    \item Figma
\end{itemize}


%Programme files: PS Will have layers to turn on and off access different elements separately. ID Vector files, layers, copy text, fonts. May include source images (links). Sketch: Super good at website & app. Vector based. Figma: We'll see

\subsubsection{Flat files ok...}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{PDFs} Good, vector-based, usually not lossy compression, often can copy text.
    \item \textbf{PNGs} Lossless.
    \item \textbf{JPGs} Lossy compression, difficult to get clean image from. Potentially different ‘colourspace’.
\end{itemize}
