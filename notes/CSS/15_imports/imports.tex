Wouldn't it be great if you could separate out your CSS into smaller files?

But annoying to include them all in your HTML?

This is what imports are for.

We import all smaller CSS files into one file and use **that** one file in our HTML.

CSS knows to go and get all the CSS in the other files.

\subsubsection{@import example}

\begin{minted}{css}
    @import 'reset.css';
    @import 'settings.css';
    @import 'typography.css';
    @import 'buttons.css';
\end{minted}

Create all these files and add into your main css file

\begin{infobox}{CSS files}
    How you break up and organise your CSS files is up to you \& very much a learning process. Think about your components, having a CSS file for each is a good place to start.
