\begin{infobox}{Lorem Ipsum}
    \textbf{Lorem Ipsum} is latin. We use blocks of latin text as \textit{placeholders} when we are building websites, before real content is added. It's a good language as it doesn't mean much to us, but is still representative of how westernised languages would appear in blocks \& sentences.
    To get \textbf{Lorem Ipsum} you can type \textit{Lorem} followed by enter into vscode, or find a \href{https://www.lipsum.com/}{generator online here}.

\subsubsection{Tables}

Tables contain a lot of HTML. Below is an example of a simple table. We only use them in HTML for data which is good to represent as a table, however they are still used to layout emails

\begin{minted}{html}
<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Dessert</th>
		<th>Calories</th>
		<th>Fat</th>
		<th>Carbs</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Frozen yogurt</td>
		<td>159</td>
		<td>6.0</td>
		<td>24</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Ice cream sandwich</td>
		<td>237</td>
		<td>9.0</td>
		<td>37</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Eclair</td>
		<td>262</td>
		<td>16.0</td>
		<td>24</td>
	</tr>
</table>
\end{minted}
