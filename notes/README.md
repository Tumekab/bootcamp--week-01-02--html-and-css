# HTML & CSS Student Notes

There are three main pdfs for the students: HTML, CSS & Web Theory.

You need to install LaTeX to generate these pdf's. Mark has a [great starter repo here](https://github.com/develop-me/latex-templates).

Command to generate (make sure you are in the directory)

`xelatex -file-line-error --halt-on-error --shell-escape filename.tex`

Or you can use the Make file

`make filename.pdf`
